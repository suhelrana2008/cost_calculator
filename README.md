# cost_calculator
A simple Python GUI-based "Cost Calculator" which will allow the user to enter in the cost of an item or service and also the quantity (amount) of that item/service being purchased and then output the total cost. Must be downloaded all the associated files to run this app perfectly. Thank you.
